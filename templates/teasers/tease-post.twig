{# To Create a custom teaser for a post type: #}
{# Extend from teasers/tease.twip, like above #}
{# Then override the teaser_content block and create your own template. #}

{# You can even use a partial-override partten by adding a new block in the teaser, like: #}
{# {% block teaser_post_content %}{% endblock %} then overriding that here, so you leave the rest of the teaser intact #}
